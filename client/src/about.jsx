          <p>
          Hello! I am an AI Software Engineering Technology student with a strong interest in AI, data analysis, and full-stack development. Through academic projects, I have built experience in Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, SQL, and MongoDB, as well as frameworks like React.js and Node.js.</p>

          <p>
          I have worked on data visualization projects such as a full-stack Formula 1 race data web platform and a Canada Province Tax Calculator. These applications involved building interactive charts, maps, and dynamic user interfaces, which strengthened my ability to transform complex datasets into clear, engaging insights.
          </p>
